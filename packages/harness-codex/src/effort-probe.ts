/**
 * Per-model effort discovery for codex.
 *
 * Codex advertises reasoning-effort vocabularies PER MODEL and exposes them
 * machine-readably: `codex app-server --stdio` speaks JSON-RPC, and the v2
 * `model/list` request answers with `data[].supportedReasoningEfforts` +
 * `defaultReasoningEffort`. The ceiling is genuinely model-scoped — gpt-5.6-sol
 * takes `ultra` while gpt-5.4 stops at `xhigh` — so a harness-wide ladder is
 * always wrong for some model.
 *
 * The vendor's own generated schema types `ReasoningEffort` as "a non-empty
 * reasoning effort value advertised by the model" (a bounded string, NOT an
 * enum). We mirror that: whatever the probe reports is what we advertise, so a
 * level newer than this repo starts working the moment codex ships it.
 *
 * A probe is never load-bearing. Missing binary, an older app-server without
 * `model/list`, a timeout or malformed output all fall back to the recorded
 * snapshot below and the run proceeds.
